- - When comparing one to many pdf files, the prompt ‘document author could not be loaded” appears.  Is there a reason we cannot do PDF multiple compare?
  - You can compare multiple PDFs, but Author cannot be detected automatically.  User needs to enter Author manually, then the Compare button will be available.
- - Why does Change-Pro crash?
  - Well, it could be for any number of reasons, but the biggest reason we've seen is due to running out of memory during the RTF conversion & compare step @ roughly 15%. 
  - We're mitigating this in the future by comparing the native XML of Office files rather than RTF. (THIS IS NOT TO BE SHARED EXTERNALLY)
- - REQUEST URI TOO LONG.
  - File and folder names have the following character limits:</br>File names are limited to 128 characters in SP2013 and 256 characters in SPO.</br>Folder names are limited to 256 characters.</br>Most importantly, the combination of folder path plus file name is limited to 260 characters. These are all boundaries (i.e., hard limits).</br>In our case the error occurs if the file path+ filename exceeds the above limitations. Below are the files that I used in testing
- - SharePoint 2010/2013- (151 characters) - seems like the file path had been ignored when the upload is on premise.

- - What languages does Change-Pro detect/work with?
  - Change-Pro compares all Latin languages and Mandarin.
  - Arabic and some East Asian languages are compared but with limitations. This is being improved.
- - How many documents can be uploaded into the system at once?
  - Change-Pro can perform both one to one and one-to-many comparisons. One-to-Many can handle one original and up to six modified at one time.
- - Can you upload multiple documents and switch between comparisons in the same session?
  - Yes. Similar to a web browser you can have several comparisons open at one time. This option is available under the Comparison drop down menu (it looks like a play button)
- - When you click “email” does it email a link to the comparison to be opened up by the recipient in the Change-Pro software or does it email a PDF attachment illustrating the comparison?
  - When you click email, it provides options to send attachments of either the original, modified, redline, or redline with track changes enabled. You can select PDF and/or Word format. 
  - Some people make multiple selections and choose the zip file option. 
  - Once selected, the attachments will be generated in a new Outlook email for sending.
