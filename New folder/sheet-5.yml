- - What is O365 Compare Add-In?
  - Litera offers integration of O365 Apps with Litera Compare Server for Comparison. 
  - The Litera Compare/O365 Add-In integration enables you to run comparisons from within O365 apps and OneDrive and display the redline in the Litera Compare browser interface.
  - O365 Compare Add-In supports both the Web and Desktop version of O365 Apps.
- - When will O365 Compare Add-In be launched?
  - O365 Compare Add-in will be launched after the end of the Q3 release cycle which ends on 21st Sep 2021. 
- - How is O365 Compare Add-In licensed?
  - This O365 App integration uses Litera's hosted Litera Compare Servers (CaaS) which works off of an 'Allow List', where the users email or domain must be added for comparisons to complete successfully. 
  - This approach will likely change in the future - we would like these integrations to be able to check against our CRM (Salesforce) to check entitlement rather than us having a separate place to maintain these records.
  - The users need to contact Litera Customer Support to do this for them.
- - What instance of CaaS Server would the comparisons sent to?
  - Documents in O365 Apps are compared in environments located within the appropriate geographical region (based on the IP Address) ensuring data isn't sent somewhere that violates local data privacy laws. 
  - For example, if youâ€™re in the U.S., the comparison will be performed by the U.S. instance of CaaS.
- - Am I entitled to use both G-Suite & O365 Integration once I have a valid Litera Compare Server License?
  - Yes, but the users email or domain needs to be whitelisted in our Allow List for them to be able to use both the integrations.
  - Whitelisting email or domain once will mean they can use either of the integrations.
- - Considering both G-Suite & O365 Integration point to the CaaS instance of Litera Compare Server, can the user access this if he has a license of Litera Compare Server (On-Prem)?
  - Any valid Litera Compare Server License (On-Prem or CaaS), will allow usage of Integration applications
- - Are we going to do a big announcement around this launch?
  - Yes, but need to wait until we deploy it on Microsoft App soruce.
- - Do I need internet connectivity for these apps to work? 
  - Yes. 
- - What Product Subscriptions give users access to O365 Compare Add-in?
  - Workshare Compare Server and Litera Compare Server subscriptions will give access to Litera Compare Server and permits users to use the integrations (they will need to be added to an Allow List to use integrations that Litera host).
