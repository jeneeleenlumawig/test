  - For more detailed and tactical scenarios, please see the DocXtools Companion When to Use file.
  - Numbering- An author would click this button when they notice their numbering is visibly incorrect, inconsistently formatted, or not advancing properly when inserting new content. 
  - This button will correct the document numbering using a numbering template, if available, will otherwise create a template if needed.
  - TOC- An author would click this button when they aren't happy with the format of their TOC, they don't have a TOC, or their TOC is broken. 
  - This button will fix the numbering in their document and then create a clean, 1 or 2-level TOC for them in the document.
  - References- An author would click this when they aren't sure if they have properly inserted automated cross references in their document and don't want to spend the time searching for them all.   
  - This button will first fix the numbering in their document and then connect all references to numbering that exists in the document.
- - Does DocXtools Companion fix all of my document issues? What will a document expert see in a document after they run all DocXtools Companion buttons?
  - DocXtools Companion was designed to fix the issues authors face every day, issues related to numbering, manually typed references, table of contents, and conversion issues. 
  - But as you know, there are MANY other issues that could occur in a document depending on where it came from, how many people have edited it, and where it is in the document lifecycle 
  - and for those issues DocXtools will still be your solution for those problems. 
  - Things like broken or missing references, problems with scanned documents, inconsistencies in firm styles, and doc to docx conversions. 
  - Power-users should continue to use DocXtools to solve these problems but authors should use DocXtools Companion every day.
- - Is there a separate license key people will need to get?
  - There will be a new separate license key that they will need to get for DXT-C. 
  - These license keys are unique for each customer (per company -- not per user) and they are validated against our license server. 
  - The license server just checks for fake keys. 
  - It does not cap the number of users or automatically stop expired products from working – but allows the sales team to know if that is occurring.
  - DXT-C will be a separate installer. The DXT-C installer will be much smaller, will not require an uninstall for upgrades, but will have slightly more modern installation requirements (OS, .NET, Office). 
  - The reduced footprint and easier installation will make it much easier to roll out across the company and keep up to date.
  - The existing license key will continue to work for DocXtools, the DocXtools installer will be unchanged, and the installation requirements will be unchanged for existing customers. 
  - The goal here is to eliminate obstacles to adopting 8.0.
- - Does DocXtools Companion Integrate with my DMS?
  - DocXtools Companion does all work against the active document.

- - What is the story for DocXtools Companion in UK, given their house styles?

  - If DocXtools Companion does apply a bespoke scheme to the document and a house style is needed, swapping one scheme or style for another can be quickly accomplished now that the document is in an automated stated. 
  - Swapping can be accomplished through DocXtools Style Application, DocXtools Numbering or a 3rd party suite of style/numbering tools where available.
  - Additionally, if the customer is on DocXtools 7.9 or higher, they will be able to configure a set of predefined numbering schemes to only be used when working with the DocXtools Companion buttons. - This will enforce house styles by name and definition.
- - Why would I use DocXtools Companion over CAS in the UK?
  - UK customers are open to using DocXtools Companion to keep fee earners productive and keep the document healthy. 
  - If it eventually needs CAS or document experts to work with it, that's fine too. Additionally, CAS is to jarring for the end users at it does things like flatten all fields in a document which would confuse the end-user. 
- - Do I need both DocXtools and DocXtools Companion?
  - Yes. DocXtools is still a necessity for document cleanup as well as other more tactical scenarios a Word Expert would find themselves in. 
  - DocXtools Companion should be looked as a complement to this larger application.
