- - Why are we making the switch to the DocXtools NTD Platform?
  - Our NTD customer base continues to ask for additional features and more flexibility which is already afforded on the DocXtools NTD platform. By making this switch, we can provide customers with these high-value feature asks almost immediately. NTD will also accomodate ALL numbering within a document, including Forte/Innova. There current Litera Numbering only recognizes schemes based on the Forte codebase and is limited in this capacity.

- - What will the customer center be offering?
  - We will be releasing the new NTD installer at the end of Q2, but will not be posting this installer to the Customer Center. This is something that will need to be requested, and coordinated with an appropriate Customer Success Manager & Solutions Engineer due to providing appropriate guidance and upgrade and migration to the changing platform.

- - What if I have a current Forte NTD customer?
  - We should start conversations about migration but support will continue for these legacy versions. As with all products, if a bug should arise we only fix forward and the customer would need to upgrade to resolve any issue. Additionally, once the notification around are new support obsolescence goes out, this will begin to more tightly govern supported versions.
- - How do I switch someone to the new NTD platform?
  - Migration is an easy process, and can be coordinated with a Solutions Engineer to provide the appropriate guidance. We can ensure the customer none of their numbering schemes, ToC schemes, or DocID formats will be lost.
