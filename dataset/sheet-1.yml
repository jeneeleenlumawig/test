- - What is Litera Microsystems' position with regard to Ribbon consolidation?
  - We will put our buttons/groups on other vendor's ribbons assuming we get the information from that vendor which allows us to do so (see below). We will create buttons and call other vendor's VBA. We will not pull other vendor's buttons/groups onto our Ribbon. We will not integrate other vendor's buttons/groups together with each other.
- - What is possible when it comes to Ribbon consolidation?
  - When people talk about Ribbon consolidation, they are referring to the idea of bringing together, in one or a few Ribbons, functionality from more than one vendor. Microsoft is included in this consideration. While it seems easy enough when you talk about it, the complexities of how Microsoft's customUI works and how various vendors manage the user interface make Ribbon consolidation more complicated than it might seem at first blush. The range of options includes&#58;
    Place our components on another vendor's Ribbon. By using a custom file, Litera Microsystems can determine where our components will be placed. As an example, to move Litera Microsystems' components around on the Word interface, the Litera Microsystems' custom file must be edited.
    Place another vendor's components on our Ribbon via customUI or comparable mechanism. To place another vendor's functionality on Litera Microsystems' Ribbon, that other vendors' customUI file or other mechanism for managing where their components reside must be updated. What this really amounts to is Litera Microsystems editing/manipulating files that belong to other vendors. This has proven to be very difficult and ineffective. We have really not had any success on this front.
    Place another vendor's components on our Ribbon using their VBA macros. To further complicate the discussion, there are some products that essentially just call a VBA macro from the Ribbon. This makes it easy for us to manipulate and move these buttons wherever they are needed. We can just set it up so that we just call their VBA macro name from a button we create and configure. Best Authority and Deal Proof are two applications we know for which we can currently take this approach.

- - What will Litera Microsystems do when it comes to Ribbon integration (using RibbonX to place buttons/groups on Ribbons)?
  - In general, the configuration we recommend is to put Litera Microsystems' buttons/groups on other vendors' ribbons. We will also call VBA macros from our Ribbons.
- - Why do we recommend pushing Litera Microsystems' buttons/groups to other vendor's ribbons rather than other options like putting another vendor's buttons/groups on our Ribbon or putting another vendor's buttons/groups on Words' Ribbon?
  - There are a number of reasons&#58;
    It is what our tool was built for.
    Because it is our component we are pushing, we know and understand it and control the custom UI file.
    The ability to add the other 3rd party vendors qualified ribbon into our admin tool, see their ribbons, and groups, and do light manipulation like hiding of features can all be done via the standard manner we build our ribbons for DocX and Word now.
    To move our buttons/groups to the other vendor's Ribbon, all we need to do in our admin tool is to copy/drag it inside of the admin interface and configure the idQ and Namespace of the vendor's ribbon.
    The only custom manipulation we need to do to our UI is to add the vendor's namespace to our XML UI file.
- - Will Litera Microsystems integrate another vendor's buttons/groups onto the native Word Ribbon?
  - No, with the exception of the cases where the other vendor is simply calling a macro from the ribbon like Best Authority.
- - Will you place Litera Microsystems' buttons/groups on native Word Ribbons?
  - Yes, with some exceptions for contextual ribbon tabs.
- - What is localization?
  - We look at localization as having three different options.<br/>
    Option 1&#58; Operating System support. Litera Microsystems product will be installable on non-English operating systems.<br/>
    Option 2&#58; User Interface Support. Litera Microsystems ribbons, buttons, menus, macros, procedures…etc.<br/>
    Option 3&#58; Document Support. Having applications that not only have the UI localized for that language but also work with that specific language when present in the document. This type of localization support has never been available and continues to not be supported.

- - What elements of DocXtools are localized?
  - In some versions of DocXtools (6.1, 6.2, 7.7, and 8.3) Litera Microsystems provided localization for a small handful of customers through the use of a Resource File. By changing the desktop regional settings, the appropriate translated values are presented. PLEASE NOTE&#58; This service is no longer available for any new implementations. Only those customers (Norton Rose, Fasken, Borden Ladner, and Miller Thompson) who already have French Canadian translated environments are able to continue with them.
    There are also content elements within DocXtools that are not controlled by the Resource File. We do this to provide flexibility, allowing customers to make modifications supporting customer specific nomenclature, processes, and other preferred wording. All of these content elements can be configured by any of our customers. For Norton Rose, Fasken, Borden Ladner, and Miller Thompson, we translated our out of the box for these content elements but assumed the customer will make their own choices on wording and language to use. Consequently, we do not support translations beyond the initial configuration delivered.
- - Does Litera Microsystems support languages other than English with their Accelerators?
  - No. The intent of these examples is that customers can extend and further configure them on their own, choosing the wording and language they prefer. An Accelerator may be translated for a fee based on customer requests, but no commitments are made to maintain these on an ongoing basis.
- - What is the latest version that supports French Canadian?
  - DocXtools 8.3 supports French Canadian localization but only for Norton Rose, Fasken, Borden Ladner, and Miller Thompson. User documentation was not translated. This translation will not be made available to any other customers or prospects unless the deal is enterprise.
    We will sell exactly what we've translated before (no NTD, no Admin, no DocXamine, no Style Application, no documentation).
    There is no discounting of services for these deals – if we quote 16 days, it's 16 days and we charge for them all.
    If a deal is sold, a cross functional team, led by the DocXtools Product Manager, will be assembled to ensure we are aligned in product and services to get the minimum done to test, resolve issues, and configure for the client.
- - Can you check a French document with the English version or vice versa?
  - The translation affects the presentation of the UI, not the capabilities of DocXtools. If they have separate rules for French Canadian documents vs. English documents, all of those rules can coexist on one machine. However, the UI must remain in one language.
