  - Litera Compare can be licensed for desktop, server or both. Clients wishing to use one of the Litera Compare Server integrations will require a Litera Compare Server license.
- - What legacy products make up the new Litera Compare offering?
  - Litera Compare (desktop) is based off of the Change-Pro product. Litera Compare Server is based off of the Workshare Compare Server product, as are all of the server-side integrations.
- - Didn't we announce Workshare Compare as the go-forward comparison product previously?
  - Yes, we did originally announce that Workshare Compare would be the go-forward comparison product. With hindsight, this was probably the wrong language to use because it was always our intention to merge the best features from Change-Pro and Workshare Compare together to make up the Litera Compare offering as our go-forward product, which is what we are still going to do.
- - Was it not our intention to use Workshare Compare (desktop) at the base for Litera Compare though? What changed?
  - Yes, we did originally plan on using the Workshare Compare (desktop) product as the base for Litera Compare (desktop). We also originally intended to bring across the core comparison engine from Change-Pro to Workshare Compare, given Litera had invested heavily in modernising the comparison engine to compare Word files natively, without needing to first convert the files to RTF - something that Workshare Compare still does today. As we planned out the work to migrate the engine from Change-Pro to Workshare Compare, we discovered that completing this work would entail changing or rewriting nearly every other aspect of Workshare Compare for Word - rendering sets, the way Track Change Redlines are produced, the Change Summary panel, the categorization of changes, the Apply Accepted Changes feature etc., so we reviewed the decision to use Workshare Compare (desktop) as the base for Litera Compare (desktop). Following this review, and after some discussions with top customers, we decided it would be in Litera's and our clients' best interests to use Change-Pro as the base for the go-forward Litera Compare (desktop) solution. 
- - Didn't we already migrate features from Change-Pro to Workshare Compare?
  - Yes, we have invested in bringing some features available in Change-Pro to Workshare Compare, such as the selection controls on the ribbon in the compare applications, comparison engine related things and improved display of comments to name a few. These features have been well received by Workshare Compare users so this is not wasted effort.
- - Have we finished migrating features from Workshare Compare (desktop) to Litera Compare (desktop)?
  - No. In fact, we have not migrated many features from Workshare Compare (desktop) to Change-Pro or Litera Compare yet. We are going to rebrand and launch our complete Litera Compare solution first and will then continue evolving Litera Compare, both with features that Workshare Compare has today, such as a PDF printer driver to create PDFs of redlines and side-by-side comparison of PowerPoint documents, and new features not available in either solution today.
- - So is Litera Compare (desktop) just going to look and behave like Change-Pro does today?
  - Yes, certainly for the initial launch at the end of Q2. We have plans to modernize the user interface of Litera Compare (desktop) after we have launched the initial version but we will take our time to make sure we get it right for all of Litera's comparison customers by doing user research and gathering feedback on our designs before we build them.
- - What will happen when installing Litera Compare (desktop) if I already have Change-Pro or Workshare Compare (desktop) installed?
  - Change-Pro will be upgraded to Litera Compare - it will be a similar experience to installing an update to Change-Pro. Note on upgrading from CP to Litera Compare - check the r-click menu in Windows Explorer file list and if they are not saying Litera Compare, restart explorer is required. If customers have Workshare Compare (desktop) or Workshare Professional installed, Litera Compare would be installed alongside it. We should recommend that clients uninstall Workshare Compare or Workshare Professional when they install Litera Compare. In the future we want the Litera Compare installer to detect Workshare Compare or Workshare Professional is installed and suggest that the user uninstalls the Workshare solution before continuing with the Litera Compare install, but we did not get this completed for the first release.
- - How does the DocsCorp acquisition affect the Litera Compare release?
  - It doesn't. We are still going to launch Litera Compare as planned. We are taking the time to review the compareDocs product and understand which features or ideas we can bring into Litera Compare in the future to help further enhance Litera's comparison offering.
- - Are we going to do a big announcement around this launch?
  - We are not expecting to make a big splash about this initial release.
- - Are the Litera Compare (desktop) ribbons configurable?
  - Yes - just like Change-Pro is today.
- - How does this change our approach to training customers?
  - It should not change anything dramatically - for desktop we will continue training users in the same way we train them to use Change-Pro. For server and the integrations, where we have fewer users, training will be the same as we do today for Workshare Compare Server/integrations.
- - How is Litera Compare licensed? What keys are used?
  - Litera Compare (desktop) will use the Litera Licensing Server for licensing. License keys beginning with 'CD', currently used for Workshare Compare, will also license Litera Compare. Litera Compare Server will use the Litera Licensing Server for licensing. License keys beginning with 'CS', currently used for Workshare Compare Server, will license Litera Compare Server. The integrations which use Litera's hosted Litera Compare Servers (CaaS), such as iManage, NetDocuments, Google Workspace and the Office 365 app, work off of an 'Allow List', where the users email or domain must be added for comparisons to complete successfully. This approach will likely change in the future - we would like these integrations to be able to check against our CRM (Salesforce) to check entitlement rather than us having a separate place to maintain these records.
- - Old Change-Pro licenses could control which parts of the application will be installed (OCR, CP for Excel, CP for PPT). Will the new 'CD' keys also control these same things in Litera Compare (desktop)?
  - No. All licenses for Litera Compare (desktop) come with a full license that will enable and install all components.
- - Will my old key for Change-Pro work with the Litera Compare (desktop) installer?
  - No. You will need to acquire your new Litera Compare key from the Customer Center.
- - Will my old key for Workshare Compare work with the Litera Compare (desktop) installer?
  - Yes.
- - Do I need internet connectivity for these apps to work?
  - Yes. During installation of Litera Compare (desktop) the license key is checked locally but the software will need to phone home to validate the license every 30 days. This aligns with Microsoft O365 subscription policies and is why we choose the 30 day window. Litera Compare Server will check the key locally on installation but it will not phone home to validate the license initially, although we can expect this licensing to be enforced in the future.
- - What if certain customers have no internet access at all? (high-security customer sites)
  - While the method of having products communicate with our servers is going to be the path forward across our product lines, there is a way of generating license keys in Salesforce that do not need to phone home to the License Server. Of course, these should only be used in circumstances where there's no other option - simply not liking the idea of license server shouldn't be enough.
- - What port does the licensing traffic leave the firm on?
  - 443 like the other applications. There's a particular URL the products are reaching out to through HTTPS
- - What Product Subscriptions give users access to Litera Compare (desktop), Litera Compare Server and the integrations?
  - Change-Pro, Workshare Compare or Litera Compare (desktop) subscriptions will give access to Litera Compare (desktop). Workshare Compare Server and Litera Compare Server subscriptions will give access to Litera Compare Server and permits users to use the integrations (they will need to be added to an Allow List to use integrations that Litera host).
- - On desktop, why does Litera Compare still reference 'Change-Pro' in certain areas, like the registry or names of DLLs?
  - The rebranding exercise focussed on updating the UI that end-users see - the applications' UI, Office ribbon, installer etc. rather than all "backend" changes such as the registry paths. This should also help upgrades from Change-Pro to Litera Compare go seamlessly. This can be a common approach when rebranding applications - we can see that with Workshare Compare, and that DeltaView is still mentioned in the registry (even the main executable is called DeltaVw.exe). We've also seen it with iManage, who still name certain DLLs or registry paths with 'iw' or 'interwoven'.
- - How will usage / telemetry data be captured?
  - For desktop, usage data will be captured the same way as it is for Change-Pro today, which utilises Microsoft Azure App Insights. For Server, usage data will be captured the same way as it is for Workshare Compare Server or the integrations for the initial launch. This utilises Mixpanel in the backend - we do want to migrate this to App Insights in the future however.
- - How should Sales / CSM be talking about this bundle from value perspective?
  - Litera Compare is the name of our go-forward comparison solution. Litera Compare incorporates the best features and functionality from the comparison solutions Litera own and will be where we continue to innovate and bring more value to our users in the future. Litera Compare is available for both desktop and server.
- - Which products will be listed on the portal once we go live with Litera Compare?
  - We have some limitations with what is possible in the Customer Center. It is likely that customers of any comparison solution (Change-Pro, Workshare Compare/Professional, Litera Compare) will see all three downloads (Change-Pro, Workshare Compare/Professional, Litera Compare)
- - If a client has a Workshare Compare subscription expiring after the release of Litera Compare, how should CSM/Renewals/Support handle the communication? Should we suggest that they move to Litera Compare or should we let him continue with Workshare Compare?
  - We should aim to move the subscription to 'Litera Compare'. Customers who are on a 'Litera Compare' subscription will still be able to download and use legacy solutions (Change-Pro, Workshare Compare/Professional) should they want to.
- - If a client’s Litera Compare subscription expires, what will happen? Will clients get any sort of 7-day warning (like they do today) or an expired message?
  - Yes, clients will get a warning 7 days before expiry and then an expired message once the license expires. Clients may also see these notifications if they have been unable to connect to the internet to refresh the license token. The license token is valid for 30 days, so if a user goes offline, they will see a warning 23 days later, and then an expired license after 30 days - regardless of the subscription end date.
- - Is Litera Compare tied to the subscription similar to Litera Check?
  - Clients who have an active subscription for Litera Compare, Change-Pro or Workshare Compare/Professional will be entitled to a license for Litera Compare. With Litera Compare, clients will get all functionality - there is no disabling of certain features or modules, such as OCR or specific comparison modules (Excel, PPT etc.) based on the license key like there was with Change-Pro.
- - Are we prepared to assist small clients when they ask for help and guidance in moving from Workshare Compare to Litera Compare?
  - We are creating documentation which we can share with clients small and large to assist with the transition from Workshare Compare to Litera Compare.
- - Will the license key be stored in registry similar to Workshare Compare?
  - The license key is encrypted and stored in the registry under the 'lk.cd.serv' key in HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\WOW6432Node\Litera\ChangePro. It is different to Workshare Compare because the key is encrypted and cannot be changed directly in the registry.
- - Will Litera Compare still use the ini files to control the keys?
  - No - the ini file is no longer used for licensing. The key is now encrypted and stored in the registry. If an old ini file has information about the old Change-Pro license, these values will be ignored in Litera Compare.
- - Will Litera Compare still have the ability to use the zip installation options used in the old versions? Ex&#58; MSI installer will read the license key if zipped and named a certain way. The installer will also read the customized files and rendering sets if zipped and named a certain way.
  - Litera Compare will use the zip installation options from old versions of Change-Pro so that customizations will be applied to Litera Compare. However this does not apply to licensing - the license key will need to be specified as part of the installation, either in the UI or via the command line if being deployed via a script.
- - How can you relicense Litera Compare?
  - Once installed, the license key cannot be changed. If a customer needs to change the license key, they will need to uninstall and reinstall the application using the new license key they want to use.
- - Will the versions.xml file continue to work to "turn off" the other modules? This file (places in users roaming profile) will cause a message to pop up stating "please contact admin (something like this)" when a user clicks on the icon to run a module they are not licensed for. Example&#58; I have a Change-Pro Premier key but only have licensed PPT, Excel for 20 seats and Word for 1000. Firms can push out the old key and then prevent PPT and Excel from running on 980 machines.
  - This functionality is not documented, nor has it been tested since Change-Pro 10.7. The code has not been removed or changed however and it appears to work. If this is something we feel is needed now, we can arrange for some more testing to take place and this can then be added to the documentation as a supported feature.
- - Litera Admin Panel tab names. On the call we discussed the Admin panel will still show ChangePro Premier. With version 7.5.169.12 it shows the name has been changed. We feel that it should read Litera Compare since we have always trained the client to use the admin Panel that goes with the version of ChangePro. Plus, new users of Litera Compare will be really confused if the name is not changed, where as ChangePro users will already know the difference.
  - LAP 7.5.169.12 is the version that will be included with Litera Compare. This does have the tab names updated and some option display names have been updated - I was wrong about this in the training (and I think everyone will be glad about that based on the feedback!).
- - So to confirm the command line to install ChangePro around the license key. We will use LicenseKey= and not License_key=?
  - We will use LICENSEKEY="XXX"
- - 7 days Expiration alert concerns and then at expires turns off the application will be a different experience for all Compare users. We need to be prepared for this. Auto-renewal needs to be looked at. We may need a way to auto-renew early?
  - We are going to monitor this and look to disable the 7-day warning in the next release of Litera Compare to alleviate these concerns.
- - We need to test going ahead and changing the folder names for clients who ask. Does it work ok?
  - Yes - changing the location for rendering sets/styles was supported in previous versions of Change-Pro. It continues to work in Litera Compare.
- - All the users are using the same key, which subscription will the users be tied to. Example&#58; Company ABZ purchases licenses for their users. User 1 buys a key July 5th, user 2 purchases a key Aug 5th, user 3 gets their key on Nov 5th. When User 1 expires a yr later, will User 2 and 3 expire too or will User 1 never expire because we will look at the last expiration date.
  - It will not necessarily be tied to any subscription. The License Server interrogates SalesForce and looks for any active subscription tied to the account/license - if it finds one, it will return a token to allow the user to continue using the software. As long as there is at least one active subscription on the account for a product, it will be considered licensed as far as the License Server is concerned. In this scenario, no users' software will stop working until there are no longer any active subscriptions. If no one renewed, then all 3 users would technically be able to continue using the software until User 3's subscription lapsed.
- - "What do we do for clients in negotiations past expire date? Every area needs instructions on how to work through this as Support will not extend the date unless approved by Jody / Georgia /Maria."
  - We've not created any new process for this - we should continue to do what we do today when we encounter this scenario.
- - What are we showing in the portal for clients to download; existing and new?
  - Any clients who have a license for Change-Pro, Workshare Compare or Litera Compare will see all comparison apps (Change-Pro, Workshare Compare and Litera Compare). We would ideally not show all comparison apps to users but we have limitations with how our current customer portal works. This is something that we will want to improve in the future - the Operations team are planning work on the portal but there is no ETA at the moment.
- - If the subscription does expire and the application stops working, how do we force a call home to get users going. They just close and open?
  - Closing and reopening should trigger the license check again - if a new subscription has been added, the new license/token should be returned by the License Server.
