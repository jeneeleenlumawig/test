  - 'Yes'
- - Which server components are required (all or can the features be selected)?
  - Only some components of Litera Desktop require a server to be installed, the most relevant will be Forte and Clause Companion. Metadact is our metadata cleaning software, and a server is required for server-side cleaning i.e. for emails sent away from the desktop. To help with planning, if you were to install all server-side components then on the low end we would recommend five servers and to get best use around eight servers. I’ve included the screenshot of the requirements below and attached the system requirements to this email.
- - Do your products require an active internet connection?
  - None of our products require an active internet connection, but some do require intermittent connection to validate license keys and connect to servers for database updates.
- - Can you share typical project timelines for the rollout of your products in large organisations?
  - The implementation of Litera Desktop varies from firm to firm, and partly depends on the available resources of the customer. While some Litera products are ready to be used out of the box, certain ones require configuration to best fit the workflows of the users and requirements of the firm. These implementations can take anywhere from a few weeks to months, depending on the firm. If you'd like to have a conversation about what your specific timeline with one of the solution engineers, who would lead the implementation at UBS, we would be happy to set this up to make sure we set the right expectations.
- - What is the difference between core and add on products? Is our pricing based on number of lawyers or number of users?
  - Core products are the primary products that drive revenue, that are widely sold, and used. These are&#58;<br/> Change-Pro Premier –TDC, XLS, PPT, and OCR, more value at a slightly higher price, room for negotiation<br/>Metadact – Go forward metadata platform, combined Server, Desktop, and SmartSend, better setup for mobile, web, and platform integration, 3BC will not be a sales focus<br/>Document Creation – Forte, Innova, and Consulting, both largely achieve the same goals, but in a different ways with diverse solution focus, we will work to craft solutions to fit in firms environments<br/>CC/LC – Go forward proofreading platform, Lexpro removed from the market with key features moved to CC mid 2018, CitationWare will be merged into LC by late 2018<br/>DocXtools – One repair brand, DXT is still enterprise only, DXT Companion can be sold per user<br/>Clause Companion – New product for the Companion Suite, for lawyers to manage their own content<br/>Companion 365 – Our conduit into small law, a stepping stone to cloud<br/>Secure Collaboration Suite – Good solutions, right direction, low sales, need more feedback and changes to create a cohesive solution<br/>Add ons are lower revenue components that are really just feature sets of one of the above core products, but were previously sold as stand alone products. Going forward these can be sold stand alone, but the sales team will not be pushing these in stand alone sales, these will typically be sold in conjunction of one of the core products listed above. These include CitationWare, SmartSend, Metadact-I, LDF, Litera NTD (formally TSG Numbering or Forte Tools)
- - What is the difference between enterprise pricing, and Litera Desktop?
  - Any core product can be quoted for the enterprise, meaning we charge for everyone in the firm/company/organization and everyone can use the software. Litera Desktop is similar, but it a combined for all the core products for everyone in the firm/company/organization.
- - What is included in Litera Desktop?  
  - There are actually three flavors of Litera desktop, each with a different list price and composed of different products&#58;<br/>Litera Desktop – All core products, including create and server components, plus any add on the customer wants (Metadact Desktop+Server, Change-Pro Premier, Contract/Litigation Companion, DocXtools, Create (Forte or Innova), Clause Companion)<br/>Litera Desktop Lite – All desktop products (Metadact Desktop, Change-Pro Premier, Contract/Litigation Companion, DocXtools, Clause Companion+Litera NTD), no server components<br/>Small Law Bundle – Desktop products (Metadact Desktop, Change-Pro Premier, Contract/Litigation Companion, DocXtools, Litera NTD), no Clause Companion or server components, this will be a flat fee of $900/user, and only up to 100 users<br/>
- - Is our pricing based on number of lawyers or number of users?
  - It depends, for when selling a number of seats that is a subset of the total user population, and thus using standard (not enterprise) discounts, simply use the number of seats requested by the customer. This could be a number of lawyers, or a subset of users. For enterprise pricing, when we are quoting for the entire firm to leverage the solution, the quote should be based off the total number of users in the firm. This is different from the past, and Microsystems always based enterprise pricing off the total number of lawyers, and neither TSG or Litera had a concept of enterprise pricing.
